              hash: 1a78f2a1a27684bf244c881555b691d63a3247f6

                Setting `LimitCORE=0` will avoid the creation of core dump files on

                containers. This will avoid cases in which a crashlooping user app ends

                up filling up the entire storage with dump files.


                Users can re-enable core dumps in their services by manually setting the

                `ulimits.core`. For example:


                ```

                services:
                  my-service:
                    ulimits:
                      core: -1
                ```


                (Where -1 is used to mean "unlimited")

                Setting `Delegate=yes` ensures that systemd will not change anything on

                the cgroups created for running the containers.


                This setting is used upstream since this commit:

                        The original delta code on the `xfer` package used to set `d.err` when

                        an unexpected EOF was found in the delta tar stream. Turns out `d.err`

                        would end up being overwritten before it was read, so that initial

                        assignment was effectively a no-op.


                        This commit simplifies the code a little bit by removing this bogus

                        assignment and also improves the error reporting a notch by adding more

                        context to the error messages.

                        This piece of code is tricky to factor out into a separate function.

                        Basically we had two options:


                        1. Create a completely reusable, DRY function that encapsulates all the
                           duplicate code. Sounds nice until you noticed that would be a
                           horrendous function with 5 return values and overly obscure
                           semantics.
                        2. We create a small set of functions with clearer interfaces and
                           semantics, but which will still lead to some code duplication between
                           the `pull` and `load` implementations.

                        I opted for the second alternative because the resulting code is much

                        easier to understand and maintain. Also, the remaining duplication is

                        mostly dumb, integration and error handling code that almost writes

                        itself as we call the new reusable functions -- so, this is sort of a

                        benign duplication.

                        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the platform flag

                        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are mixing multi and single

                        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images, particularly when

                        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to multi-arch solves this as the docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the manifest.

                        There were various usages of Bash-specific features. As a result, the

                        script would work correctly only on OSes that have `sh` as an alias to

                        `bash`. It would fail on Ubuntu, for example.

                        A couple of changes here:


                        * Check for sudo necessity and availability before doing any real work.
                          Better to warn and exit quick and early!
                        * Remove the support for using `su`. It was broken for two reasons.
                          First, unlike `sudo`, `su -c` expects the command as a single
                          argument. Second, `su`, unlike `sudo`, reads the password from stdin
                          which in this case "contains" the tarball being downloaded. The second
                          point is particularly tricky to solve without saving the tarball to
                          storage (and we want to avoid extra storage space and wear). And,
                          anyway, users that can `su -c` can also `su` manually before
                          installing.

                        * Fix the actual check. We previously used `[ $abort ] && exit 1` which
                          caused the script to always exit (`abort` is never empty).

                        call, without needing to look under the hood.
